## Description
The game fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API when the page loads.
The 'startGame' function initializes the game state, shuffles the questions, and displays the first question.
The 'showQuestion' function displays a question and its options, decoding any HTML entities in the question and options.
The game allows the user to click on an option to select an answer. If the answer is correct, the score is incremented.
The game also allows the user to use the right arrow key to move to the next question.
When all questions are answered, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
The game uses event listeners to respond to user input and update the game state accordingly.
